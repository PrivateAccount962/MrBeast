== YouTube content ==
Early in his career, Donaldson's content usually consisted of [[Let's Plays]], "best and worst" videos and YouTube commentary.<ref name="M&H" /><ref name=":6" /> Donaldson's present-day videos are categorized into three genres: stunt videos, where Donaldson or other participants perform challenges that are interesting, challenging, or dangerous; "junklord" videos, where Donaldson uses a large quantity of a particular product in an unusual way or spends an extravagant amount on it; and giveaway videos, where Donaldson gives away large amounts of money or extravagant prizes to people, usually including a competitive aspect.{{Efn|name="genreExamples"|Examples of each genre:<ref name="M&H" />
* Stunt: "Microwaving a microwave", "I counted to 100,000"
* Junklord: "I built a giant house using only Lego's", "I ate $100,000 golden ice cream"
* Giveaway: "Extreme $500,000 game of tag", "Giving a random homeless man $10,000"
}} Giveaway videos are considered to be a distinctive feature of Donaldson's content.<ref name="M&H" />

Donaldson's videos leverage YouTube's [[recommendation system|recommendation algorithm]] in order to go [[Viral video|viral]], mainly by maximizing [[click-through rate]] and viewer retention.<ref name="M&H">{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Vincent |last2=Hogg |first2=Eddy |title='If you press this, I'll pay': MrBeast, YouTube, and the mobilisation of the audience commodity in the name of charity |journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies |date=8 March 2023 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=997–1014 |doi=10.1177/13548565231161810|s2cid=257461167 |doi-access=free }}</ref> To maximize click-through rate, he focuses on creating effective topics, titles and thumbnails.<ref name="BI">{{cite web |last=Perelli |first=Amanda |title=How YouTube star MrBeast, who has 22 million subscribers, uses keywords and the 'shock and awe' effect to maximize views |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtube-star-mr-beast-uses-keywords-to-get-trending-2019-7 |website=Business Insider |access-date=26 July 2023}}</ref> In an interview with [[Lex Fridman]], he stated that for him to create a viral video, it needed to be "original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before".<ref>{{cite podcast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3_PwvvfxIU&t=2506s|title=MrBeast: Future of YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram|host=Lex Fridman|date=11 January 2023|time=41:46|access-date=26 July 2023}}</ref> His titles are designed to attract attention by promising outrageous stunts, and using certain keywords like "24-hours" and "challenge".<ref name=":0" /><ref name="BI" /> His thumbnails are designed to be easily understandable, clearly focused and brightly colored.<ref name="BI2">{{cite news |last=Perelli |first=Amanda |title=YouTube star MrBeast breaks down how he makes eye-catching thumbnails and why he'd pay $10,000 for the best possible one |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-youtube-thumbnail-strategy-advice-for-creators-2021-10 |access-date=26 July 2023 |work=Business Insider}}</ref> To maximize viewer retention, Donaldson paces the videos to have viewers engaged throughout. His videos typically span 10–20 minutes. He hooks viewers by explaining the premise in under half a minute at the start of the video,<ref name=":0" /> and promises a "finale" to have viewers engaged until the end of the video.<ref name="M&H" />

=== Personal views ===

In an April 2022 interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', Donaldson announced that he was no longer an evangelical Christian and identified himself as an [[Agnostic theism|agnostic]]. He also stated that he had long disagreed with [[Christianity and homosexuality|the church's position on homosexuality]]. He states that during the time he grew up in "the heart of the [[Bible Belt]]", he had religion "beat into [his] head every day", and was taught that "gay people are the reason God's going to come and burn this Earth". Although he considered [[anti-LGBT rhetoric]] to be normal growing up, he has disavowed it since then, stating: "I realized, 'Oh, this isn't normal. This is just a weird place I grew up in.' So, that type of thing, I [wish I could] go back in time and be like, 'Hey, stop'."<ref name=":102"/><ref name=":72">{{Cite web |last=Darling |first=Daniel |date=April 19, 2023 |title=Reality intrudes on MrBeast |url=https://wng.org/opinions/reality-intrudes-on-mrbeast-1681905138 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230422002250/https://wng.org/opinions/reality-intrudes-on-mrbeast-1681905138 |archive-date=April 22, 2023 |access-date=2023-04-22 |website=WORLD |language=en}}</ref>

Donaldson considers himself strictly apolitical, saying that "I don't want to alienate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. ...

Donaldson is one of the most well-liked YouTubers on the platform. A poll from [[Insider Inc.|Insider]] showed that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Asarch |first=Steven |date=February 16, 2021 |title=POWER RANKING: the 10 most well-liked influencers on the internet |url=https://www.insider.com/most-liked-influencers-insider-data-mrbeast-markiplier-corpse-2021-2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224084324/https://www.insider.com/most-liked-influencers-insider-data-mrbeast-markiplier-corpse-2021-2 |archive-date=February 24, 2022 |access-date=May 6, 2021 |website=Insider |language=en-US}}</ref>  His channel appeals strongly to younger viewers.<ref name="RS" /><ref name="TIME">{{cite magazine |last=Espada |first=Mariah |title=Why MrBeast's New Video Became The Second Most Watched in 24 Hours in YouTube History |url=https://time.com/6287028/mrbeast-youtube-views-record/ |access-date=25 November 2023 |magazine=Time |date=13 June 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Yahoo">{{cite news |last=Frost |first=Alexandra |title=Kids obsessed with MrBeast?

In particular, Donaldson links audience engagement to charitable acts through statements like "every single time someone subscribes, I will give away ten cents" and "100% of my revenue earned from [Beast Philanthropy] is going to my charity", which allows Donaldson to perform acts of charity and build a large and loyal fanbase.<ref name="M&H" /><ref name="CNN" /> Donaldson also builds a [[parasocial relationship]] with his viewers by "looking directly at the camera and talking to the audience"<ref name="Yahoo" /> and displaying himself as "an exciting, relatable, authentic, down-to-earth person".<ref name="Yahoo" /><ref name="CNN">{{cite news |last=Karimi |first=Faith |title=Behind the staggering success of MrBeast |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/15/entertainment/mrbeast-youtube-jimmy-donaldson-cec/index.html |access-date=25 November 2023 |work=CNN |date=15 July 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

However, some critics have questioned Donaldson's motives and ethics.

According to Charissa Cheong of [[Insider Inc.|Insider]], Donaldson becoming the most-subscribed YouTuber marks a shift in YouTube content away from traditional [[vlogging]] towards high-production, elaborate videos that create a more "television-like experience". She wrote that "the future of YouTube content will likely look more 'experimental' now that Donaldson's high-stakes challenges are performing so well.
